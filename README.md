Same Game for iOS
=================

Overview
--------

This is a basic implementation of the classic [Japanese game](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SameGame) built for iPad on iOS 5. Built as a learning exercise. The challenge was creating an adequately robust model and a custom "box-control."

Here's a screen shot of gameplay:
